=item SDLx::App

Now depends on L<SDLx::Surface>. To get the SDL::Surface, use C< ->surface() >. Alternatively L<SDLx::Surface::display()|SDLx::Surface/display>.

=item SDLx::Surface

C< get_display > is now called L<SDLx::Surface::display|SDLx::Surface/display>. 

=item SDLx::Sprite::Animated

Has drastically changed, and is still volatile.

=head2 2.500

=over 

=item SDL::App 

SDL::App has migrated to SDLx::App namespace. The reason for this is because it is an extenstion and not a 1:1 XS/Constant Module to the c library.

=item SDL::Game::Rect 

SDL::Game::Rect has migrated to SDLx::Rect namespace. Same reasoning as above.

=head1 AUTHORS

See L<SDL/AUTHORS>.
